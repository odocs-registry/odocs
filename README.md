# ODocs: Open Documentation Registry for AI Code Generation

![Under Construction](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Under%20Construction-yellow)

## Welcome to ODocs! 👋

ODocs is an open-source documentation registry initiative that helps AI models generate code compatible with your specific framework versions, solving the "version blindness" problem in AI-assisted development.

## 🚧 Under Construction 🚧

This project is currently in early development. We're validating the concept and building the foundation for the documentation registry.

## How It Will Work

ODocs will:
- Automatically detect which frameworks and versions your project uses
- Pull the right documentation from a versioned registry
- Use vector embeddings to efficiently retrieve relevant documentation
- Feed this context to your AI coding assistant
- Result: Framework-specific code that works on the first try!

## Get Involved

If you're interested in this project:
- ⭐ Star this repository to show your support
- 📣 Share your experiences with version mismatches in AI coding
- 🧠 Join the discussion in the [Issues](https://github.com/odocs-registry/odocs/issues) section

## Stay Tuned

We'll be sharing more details about our progress and how you can contribute soon!
